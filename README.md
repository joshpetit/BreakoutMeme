Name: Joshua Petitma

### Timeline

Start Date: Sunday

Hours Spent: My eyes bleed.

### Resources Used
JavaFX documentation.

### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed: Provided in resources under standard maven hierarchy.

Key/Mouse inputs:
Move Top Paddle: A and F
Move Bottom Paddle: H and L

Where are my VIM homies!?!?!

Cheat keys:
INSERT to add more balls
the EQUALS key to increase paddle speed
the PLUS numpad key to add health
the MINUS numpad key ot subtract health
the button to the right of 0 to slow down ball. (The 'Dash' key??)

### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Known Bugs:
*   If a ball hits a brick from the top it is automatically broken. If the 
    
*    game starts with too many bricks there's a 1% chance that the game will crash. It happened one time


Extra credit:
I made a dollar with doctor phil on it. And like 10 different bricks.


### Impressions
THIS WAS REALLY FUN. I don't even play video games. In the morning I'll right a more thorough
refleciton...
